# ERRATA

The TIP on page 17 is wrong, instead of:

> The script for plotting a generated MIDI file can be found in the GitHub code for this chapter in the Chapter01/provided folder. The script is called midi2plot.py.

It should read:

> The library VisualMIDI for plotting a generated MIDI file can be found at [github.com/dubreuia/visual_midi](https://github.com/dubreuia/visual_midi). It provides a command line utility `visual_midi`.
