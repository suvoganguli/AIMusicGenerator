  Uses the bundle name to download the bundle in the "bundles" directory if it
  doesn't already exist, then uses the sequence generator and the generator id
  to get the generator. Parameters can be provided for the generation phase.
  The MIDI and plot files are written to disk in the "output" folder, with the
  filename pattern "<generator_name>_<generator_id>_<date_time>" with "mid" or
  "html" as extension respectively.

      :param bundle_name: The bundle name to be downloaded and generated with.

      :param sequence_generator: The sequence generator module, which is the
      python module in the corresponding models subfolder.

      :param generator_id: The id of the generator configuration, this is the
      model's configuration.

      :param primer_filename: The filename for the primer, which will be taken
      from the "primers" directory. If left empty, and empty note sequence will
      be used.

      :param qpm: The QPM for the generated sequence. If a primer is provided,
      the primer QPM will be used and this parameter ignored.

      :param total_length_steps: The total length of the sequence, which
      contains the added length of the primer and the generated sequence
      together. This value need to be bigger than the primer length in bars.

      :param temperature: The temperature value for the generation algorithm,
      lesser than 1 is less random (closer to the primer), bigger than 1 is
      more random

      :param beam_size: The beam size for the generation algorithm, a bigger
      branch size means the generation algorithm will generate more sequence
      each iteration, meaning a less random sequence at the cost of more time.

      :param branch_factor: The branch factor for the generation algorithm,
      a bigger branch factor means the generation algorithm will keep more
      sequence candidates at each iteration, meaning a less random sequence
      at the cost of more time.

      :param steps_per_iteration: The number of steps the generation algorithm
      generates at each iteration, a bigger steps per iteration meaning there
      are less iterations in total because more steps gets generated each time.
