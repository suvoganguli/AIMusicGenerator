# Chapter 3 - Generating polyphonic melodies

[![Magenta Version 1.1.7](../docs/magenta-v1.1.7-badge.svg)](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/releases/tag/1.1.7)

This chapter will show the importance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in generating longer sequences. We'll see how to use a monophonic Magenta model, the Melody RNNâ€”an LSTM network with a loopback and attention configuration. You'll also learn to use two polyphonic models, the Polyphony RNN and Performance RNN, both LSTM networks using a specific encoding, with the latter having support for note velocity and expressive timing.

## Magenta Versioning

```diff
- A newer version of this code is available.
```

This branch shows the code for Magenta v1.1.7, which corresponds to the code in the book. For a more recent version, use the updated [Magenta v2.0.1 branch](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/hands-on-music-generation-with-magenta/tree/magenta-v2.0.1/Chapter03).

## Code

Before you start, follow the [installation instructions for Magenta 1.1.7](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/hands-on-music-generation-with-magenta/tree/master/Chapter01#installing-magenta).

### [Example 1](chapter_03_example_01.py) or [notebook](notebook.ipynb)

This example shows a melody (monophonic) generation using the Melody RNN model and 3 configurations: basic, lookback and attention. For the Python script, while in the Magenta environment (`conda activate magenta`):

```bash
# Runs 3 melody rnn generation using the basic, lookback and attention config
python chapter_03_example_01.py
```

For the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

### [Example 2](chapter_03_example_02.py)

This example shows polyphonic generations with the Polyphony RNN model. For the Python script, while in the Magenta environment (`conda activate magenta`):

```bash
# Runs 4 polyphonic generations using polyphony rnn and
# different configurations
python chapter_03_example_02.py
```

### [Example 3](chapter_03_example_03.py)

This example shows polyphonic generations with the Performance RNN model. For the Python script, while in the Magenta environment (`conda activate magenta`):

```bash
# Runs 3 polyphonic generations using performance rnn and 
# different configurations
python chapter_03_example_03.py
```
